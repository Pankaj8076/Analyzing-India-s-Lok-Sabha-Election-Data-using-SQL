# 🇮🇳 Analyzing India’s Lok Sabha Election Data Using SQL  
*A Data Analysis + Business Analysis Project by Pankaj Chavan*

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes multi-year Lok Sabha election datasets using SQL to uncover insights on **voter behaviour, party performance, candidate demographics, and constituency-level patterns**.  
The goal was to clean the data, structure it into meaningful components, and generate analysis-ready outputs—similar to tasks performed by **Business Analysts** and **Data Analysts** in real-world BFSI and governance analytics.

Using SQL, I explored the dataset, validated fields, removed duplicates, segmented leaders by age group, analyzed vote ranges, and compared the 2014 and 2019 election results using JOIN operations.  
The project demonstrates strong skills in **data cleaning, SQL logic, KPI design, business analysis, and trend interpretation**.
